BirtReportTool 

Overview

Eclipse BIRT allows the creation of reports based on data from different data sources. Data sources define where the data is stored.

BIRT provides for example the following data sources:

Databases (via JDBC)

Text Files (cvs, XML)

WebServices (via WSDL-Files)

Scripting Data sources

You use in BIRT "Data sets" to defines queries on data source. These data sets can be used in a report.

In a Java program it is often convenient to use Java objects as a data source for reports. This article will focus on the usage of Plain Old Java Objects (POJO) as data sources for BIRT reports.
